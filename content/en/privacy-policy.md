This privacy policy applies only to the websites and services controlled by LG Electronics Inc. ("LGE") where this privacy policy is posted (collectively, the "Website"). BY USING THE WEBSITE, YOU CONSENT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND TO OUR PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR THE PURPOSES STATED BELOW. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE WEBSITE.

**A. Information Collected**

This privacy policy applies only to information collected on the Website and does not apply to information collected by LGE through any other means.

We collect two types of information from visitors to the Website: (1) Personally Identifiable Information; and (2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information, such as your IP address or cookies.

(1) Personally Identifiable Information

"Personally Identifiable Information" is information that identifies you personally, such as your email address, forum nickname, or in some cases, your company name. LGE collects and stores the personally identifiable information that you have provided to us. Here are some examples of manners in which we may collect your personally identifiable information on the Website:

* We may collect your e-mail address if you register for the Website, create a profile, or otherwise log-on or use any portion of the Website;

* We may collect your e-mail address that is shared by our third party open source discussion platform (e.g. Discourse.org);

* We may collect your email address if you upload content, software or applications to the Website;

* We may collect your e-mail address and may tie that information to your non-personally identifiable information, described below, in an effort to track your usage of the Website so that we can deliver content and information to you that meet your needs;

* We may collect registration details about any content, software or other applications that you upload or download from the Website and this information may be tied to your e-mail address;

The above list provides an example of the personally identifiable information that may be collected on the Website. If you do not want LGE to collect your personally identifiable information, please do not provide it to us.

(2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information

"Non-Personally Identifiable Information" can be technical information or it can be demographic information, such as your age, location or interests. Non-personally identifiable information does NOT identify you personally. Here are some examples of the non-personally identifiable information that is collected via the Website:

* Internet Protocol (IP) address -- Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data -- such as the webpages you view.

* Cookie -- A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used to collect information about your activity on the Website. For example, when someone visits a page within the Website, a cookie is placed on the user’s machine (if the user accepts cookies) or is read if the user has visited the Website previously. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but if you do, you may not be able to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other users to the Website. Some of the cookies we use may be flash cookies or Adobe cookies. While they are harmless, they may contain non-personally identifiable information and depending on your browser these cookies may not normally be deleted when your cookies are deleted. Please check your browser to determine where these types of cookies are stored and how they may be deleted.

* Product Information -- we may collect registration information or other details about any content, software or application that you upload from or download to the Website. Unless this information is tied to your name or address, it is not considered personally identifiable.

We collect the above non-personally identifiable information from all visitors to the Website. If you do not want LGE to have access to this information, please do not visit the Website.

**B. Use of Information Collected Via the Website**

(1) Personally Identifiable Information

We use your personally identifiable information that is collected on this Website primarily for the following purposes:

* To deliver information, content and other services to you;

* To provide services you request;

* To alert you to special offers, updated information and other new products or services from LGE, or other third parties, or to forward promotional materials to you;

* To complete a transaction or service requested by you;

* To fulfill the terms of a promotion;

* To ensure the Website is relevant to your needs;

* To help us create and publish content most relevant to you;

* To notify you about a material change to this privacy policy or the Terms of Use Agreement, if necessary;

* To allow you access to limited-entry areas of the Website; and

* To contact you in response to sign up forms such as Contact Us or other inquiry.

(2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information

Non-personally identifiable information is used as described above and in other ways as permitted by applicable laws, including combining non-personally identifiable information with personally identifiable information.

Usage Information: This refers to the information measured and recorded during your use of the Website and includes, but not limited to, log information.

**C. Sharing and Disclosure of Information**

(1) Personally Identifiable Information

We may share or disclose your personally identifiable information in the following instances:

* To fulfill a service to you. For example, if you upload or download content, software or applications from the Website, we may share your personally identifiable information in order to fulfill your request. In addition, if you email us a question, we may use your email address to process your request and respond to your question. If you download a content, software or an application from the Website, we may need to share your data with third parties in order to have that content, software or application delivered to you. Also, if you are entering a sweepstakes or contest, we may use your personally identifiable information in order to fulfill the terms of that promotion.

* To our parent company, subsidiaries and affiliates in order to better serve you. LGE may have to share your data with these parties in order to provide you with services that have been requested by you, or so that we can ensure our services and products are meeting your needs. For example, in some instances LGE may be required to transfer your data to our parent company in Korea in order to provide you with applications for the Smart TV or Mobile Device service, or any other product or service requested by you.

* To strategic partners, agents, third party service providers, or other unaffiliated parties, that work with LGE to provide content, software, applications or other products or services to LGE. These third parties may need your data in order to fulfill a service to you. For example, LGE may need to provide your data to a third party service provided in order to ensure an application developed by you works on LGE products.

* To unaffiliated third-party service providers, agents or independent contractors who help us maintain the Website and provide other administrative services to us (including, but not limited to, order processing and fulfillment, providing customer service, maintaining and analyzing data, sending customer communications on LGE’s behalf, and entry collection, winner selection and prize fulfillment for contests, sweepstakes and other promotions). We seek to ensure that these unaffiliated third parties will not use the personally identifiable information for any other purpose than to provide the administrative services for which they are responsible. Because such unaffiliated third-party service providers that help us administer the Website will have access to users’ personally identifiable information, if you do not wish for our unaffiliated third-party service providers to have access to your information, please do not register or submit any personally identifiable information to us.

* To comply with the law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the requirements of law or comply with legal process served on us, protect and defend our rights or property, including the rights and property of LGE or act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of our end users.

* To third parties as part of any corporate reorganization process including, but not limited to, mergers, acquisitions, and sales of all or substantially all of our assets.

* To track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers and provide such information to third parties.

* To protect against potential fraud, we may verify with third parties the information collected from the Website. In the course of such verification, we may receive personally identifiable information about you from such services.

Except as described in this Privacy Policy or at the time we request the information, we do not otherwise use, share or otherwise disclose your personally identifiable information to any third parties.

(2) Non-Personally Identifiable Information

We use non-personally identifiable information collected on the Website in the manner disclosed above, in the Section A (2). We may share this non-personal information with third parties.

**D. Collection and Use of Information from Children Under the Age of 14**

LGE does not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from anyone under the age of 14 or knowingly allow such persons to use the Website. If you are under 14 please do not attempt to register on the Website or send us any Personal Information.

**E. International Transfer of Information**

If you choose to provide us with personally identifiable information, LGE may transfer that information to its affiliates and subsidiaries or to other third parties, across borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world which may not have the same data protection laws as your country and by providing your personally identifiable information you consent to:

* the use of your personally identifiable information for the uses identified above in accordance with this privacy policy; and

* the transfer of your personally identifiable information to the Netherlands(EU) as indicated above.

**F. Opt-Out**

From time to time, we communicate with users who subscribe to our services via email or text message. For example, we may use your email address to confirm your request, to send you information about changes to our products and services, and to send notices and other disclosures as required by law. Generally, users cannot opt-out of these communications, but they will be primarily informational in nature rather than promotional.

However, we provide you the opportunity to exercise an opt-out choice if you do not want to receive other types of communication from us, such as emails or updates from us regarding new services and products offered on the Website or if you do not want us to share your personally identifiable information with third parties. The opt-out choice may be exercised by ticking or un-ticking the appropriate box in the My Account menu or if such checkbox is available at the points where personally identifiable information is collected or by contacting us. We will process your unsubscribe as soon as possible, but please be aware that in some circumstances you may receive a few more messages until the unsubscribe is processed.

**G. Forums, Chat Rooms and Other Public Posting Areas**

Please note that any information you include in a message you post to any product review board, chat room, forum or other public posting area is available to anyone with Internet access. If you don’t want people to know your e-mail address, for example, don’t include it in any message you post publicly.

**H. Third Party Website**

This statement applies solely to information collected on the Website. The Website may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other sites.

**I. Assignment**

In the event that all or part of our assets are sold or acquired by another party, or in the event of a merger, you grant us the right to assign the personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information collected via the Website.

**J. Changes to this Privacy Policy**

We reserve the right to change this privacy policy from time to time. When we do, we will also revise the "last update" date at the bottom of this privacy policy. For changes to this privacy policy that may be materially less restrictive on our use or disclosure of personal information you have provided to us, we will attempt to obtain your consent before implementing the change by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your account or by placing a prominent notice on the Website.

**K. Security**

No data transmissions over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you understand that any information that you transfer to LGE is done at your own risk.

Once we receive your transmission, we make reasonable efforts to ensure security on our systems. We use firewalls to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of such firewalls and secure server software.

If we learn of a security systems breach we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. By using this Website or providing personally identifiable information to us you agree that we can communicate with you electronically regarding security, privacy and administrative issues relating to your use of this Website. We may post a notice on the Website if a security breach occurs. We may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to us in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.

**L. Contacting LGE**

If you have any questions about this privacy policy or our privacy practices, please contact us at <develop@webosose.org>. All information you provide in any written communication will also be covered by this policy.
