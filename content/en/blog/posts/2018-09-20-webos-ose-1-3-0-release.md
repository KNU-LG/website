1. Platform agnostic browser UI written on top of [Enact](https://enactjs.com) framework

Key features of Enact browser are as follows:

* Basic navigation using address bar and backward/forward button
* History
* Bookmark
* Most visited sites
* Recently closed sites
* Preferences
* Startup page selection
* Search engine selection
* Some customized layout options

## H/W Accelerated URI/MSE Playback

This release includes **g-media-pipeline**, a new media pipeline for webOS OSE. g-media-pipeline is a [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/)-based media pipeline which supports URI playback and [Media Source Extensions](https://www.w3.org/TR/media-source/) (MSE) playback on webOS OSE.

The capabilities of g-media-pipeline are as follows:

* Supports H/W accelerated media playback for video encoded with H.264 codec
* Supports multiple media playback instances, if hardware resources are available
* Supports adaptive streaming both for URI playback and MSE playback
