## Qt 6.2 beta integration
webOS OSE has integrated Qt 6.2 beta release into its platform. Qt 6.2 is the first Long Term Support (LTS) release for the Qt 6 series. For more information about Qt 6.2, see [Qt roadmap for 2021](https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-roadmap-for-2021).

## Enact update (4.0.3)
Applications in OSE have been updated to reflect the latest Enact version 4.0.3.

## Audio routing through second display
Audio streams can be routed to the second display's audio output. webOS OSE supports dual display since 2.0.0 release. So far, each display works with their designated audio output. This feature enables audio streams can be routed and played on the second display side.
