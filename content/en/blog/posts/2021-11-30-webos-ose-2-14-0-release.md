## Switch to 64-bit builds (32-bit builds deprecated)
64-bit webOS OSE image is now the default build and 32-bit builds have been deprecated. The switch to 64-bit builds is applied to both Raspberry Pi 4 target and OSE Emulator. See [Building webOS OSE](/docs/guides/setup/building-webos-ose/) and [Emulator User Guide](/docs/tools/sdk/emulator/virtualbox-emulator/emulator-user-guide/) for more information about 64-bit builds in webOS OSE. 

## Visual Studio Code Extension for webOS OSE
A Microsoft Visual Studio (VS) Code Extention for webOS OSE has been released to [the market place of Visual Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode). This extension helps developers easily create webOS OSE apps/services (web apps, Enact apps, JS services).

## Camera App
webOS OSE has incorporated a camera app into its sample apps catalog. This sample camera app implements fundamental camera features of webOS OSE so that developers can kick start their implementation of camera features.
