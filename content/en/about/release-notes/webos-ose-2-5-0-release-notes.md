## Fixed Issues

## Known Issues

  - `com.webos.service.ai.voice/getResponse` transits to the `answering` state twice when using Google Assistant API.
  - As the RPi4 kernel doesn't recognize a hard-disk of size 2TiB with NTFS filesystem, `com.webos.service.pdm/getAttachedStorageDeviceList` returns `"isMounted": false`.
  - The target device reboots if available memory is less than 7MB.
