This page explains general concepts related to web apps for webOS Open Source Edition (OSE).

Web apps built for a webOS device are similar to standard web apps that use web-based technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Developers with experience in building web apps can easily start developing web apps for webOS OSE.

If you run 8 or more web apps at the same time on Raspberry Pi 4, the system might crash due to limitation of the VC4 (VideoCore 4) driver present in the Raspberry Pi.

Let us understand some webOS-specific concepts regarding web apps.

## Web App Management

In a webOS system, the following components are related to web app management:

- **System and Application Manager (SAM)** oversees the behavior of apps and manages each app throughout its lifecycle, including the installation, launch, termination, and removal of the app.
- **Web Application Manager (WAM)** is responsible for launching and managing web apps.

For details, see [Architecture Overview]({{< relref "architecture-overview" >}}) and [Web App Lifecycle]({{< relref "web-app-lifecycle" >}}).

## Web App Types

In a webOS system, web apps are categorized by the packaging/delivery method as follows:

- **External Web App**
    - The web app is installed on the webOS target device.
    - This approach helps 3<sup>rd</sup> party developers to create a web app running on webOS devices.
- **Built-in Web App**
    - The web app is built into the webOS image.
    - This approach is used by platform developers and contributors to add a web app that enhances the functionality of the platform.

## Web App Framework

webOS OSE provides Enact, a React-based application framework optimized for webOS OSE. For developer guides and API reference of Enact, check the [project website](http://enactjs.com).
