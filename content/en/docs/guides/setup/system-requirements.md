Before you set up an environment for webOS Open Source Edition (OSE) development, make sure that you prepare the target device and systems that meet the following requirements.

{{< note >}}
webOS OSE cannot be built directly on the target device. You must use a separate Linux machine that meets the [Build System Requirements](#build-system-requirements).
{{< /note >}}

## Target Device Requirements

A **target device** is a device that runs webOS OSE. To test apps and services on your target device, we recommend that you prepare the following set of hardware and peripheral devices.

### For webOS OSE 2.0 or Higher

* Raspberry Pi 4
* microSD card (8 GB or larger) and microSD card reader device
* HDMI-compatible touchscreen using USB interface, with 1920x1080 resolution
* Micro HDMI to HDMI cable
* Ethernet cable and internet connection
* (Optional) Input devices such as a keyboard and a mouse

{{< note >}}
* webOS OSE 2.0 officially supports **[Raspberry Pi 4 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/)**. To avoid insufficient memory issues, the recommended RAM memory of Raspberry Pi 4 is **4 GB or 8 GB**.
* webOS OSE 2.0 is designed for touch interface, so we recommend that you use a touch device as an input device for the target device. If you use a keyboard and a mouse as input devices, some functionalities might not work.
{{< /note >}}

{{< caution >}}
We do not provide official support for issues caused by running webOS OSE 2.0 on Raspberry Pi 3.
{{< /caution >}}

### For webOS OSE 1.x

* Raspberry Pi 3
* microSD card (8 GB or larger) and microSD card reader device
* HDMI-compatible monitor and cable
* Input devices such as a keyboard and a mouse
* Ethernet cable and internet connection

{{< note >}}
webOS OSE 1.x officially supports **[Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/)**.
{{< /note >}}

## Build System Requirements

A **build system** is a computer that builds an image from webOS OSE source code. To build a webOS OSE image, you need a **Linux** machine. Building under Windows or macOS is currently not supported.

### Operating System

webOS OSE can be built on the 64-bit version of Ubuntu Long Term Support (LTS) releases, including:

* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus) 64-bit
* Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver) 64-bit
* Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa) 64-bit

{{< caution >}}
* We strongly advise you NOT to use a Linux virtual machine on Windows or macOS for building webOS OSE, as it may cause unexpected issues.
* Since webOS OSE 2.7.0, for building the VirtualBox emulator you need the following:

    * Ubuntu 20.04 build system
    * Additional code patch

    For more details on how to build and patch, visit [webOS OSE emulator GitHub](https://github.com/webosose-emulator/build-webos).
{{< /caution >}}

### Hardware

* CPU
    * Minimum: Intel Core i5 dual-core with 4 threads
    * Recommended: Intel Core i7 quad-core with 8 threads or higher
* RAM
    * Minimum: 8 GB
    * Recommended: 16 GB or higher
* Storage
    * Minimum: HDD with 100 GB of free disk space
    * Recommended: SSD with 100 GB of free disk space or more

### Git

Before you start building webOS OSE, you need to [set up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) on your build system.

## Host Machine Requirements

On the **host machine**, you can flash the built image to the target device or use SDK tools for further development processes. You can use Linux, Windows, or macOS for the host machine.

{{< note >}}
The build system (Linux machine) can be also used as a host machine for further development processes.
{{< /note >}}

### Operating System

Recommended version for each operating system are as follows:

* Linux: Ubuntu 14.04 LTS or higher
* Windows: Windows 7 or higher
* macOS: Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard or higher

### Software Tools

Prepare the following tools on the host machine.

#### Git
To use SDK tools properly, [set up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) on your host machine.

#### Tools for Enact-based App Development

To develop an app using Enact library, you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). For information on the suitable version, refer to [Enact Installation](http://enactjs.com/docs/developer-tools/cli/installation/) page.
